3-Wire Sensors
Connect the three wires to the three right-most contacts. 
Use a multimeter to determine which wires connect together directly (2 ohms or so between them) 
and which connect through the RTD. Chances are the wires that connect together are the same color. 
The two wires that are connected together should go in the right-most blocks (labeled F+ and RTD+). 
It doesn't matter which of the matched pair is on the outside or inside. 
The third wire that is on the other side of the RTD connects to the left (marked F- or RTD-). 
It doesn't matter which slot it's in!
You will have to cut the thin trace in between the 2-way jumper on the right side of the board, 
and then solder closed the blob on the right side.

Then next to the terminal block on the left, solder closed that jumper as well. 
Alternatively you can put a piece of wire into the terminal blocks to 'short' them
